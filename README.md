This repository demonstrates a common CSS error: a background image failing to load due to an incorrect file path. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `solution.css` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from using an incorrect relative path to the image file.  The solution shows how to properly specify the path to ensure the background image loads correctly.
